# Data Structures
Perpose of this repository is to practice basic Data Structures Implementation in C#

## What is a Data Structure
A data sturucture (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Abstruct Data Type
An abstruct data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. 
The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.



| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS) |
| --- | --- |
| List | Dynamic Array, Linked List |
| Queue | Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue |
| Map | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table |
| List | Dynamic Array, Linked List |
