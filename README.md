# Data Structures
Perpose of this repository is to practice basic Data Structures Implementation in C#

## What is a Data Structure
A data sturucture (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Abstruct Data Type
An abstruct data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to. 
The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.



| Abstraction (ADT) | Implementation (DS) |
| --- | --- |
| List | Dynamic Array, Linked List |
| Queue | Linked List based Queue, Array based Queue, Stack based Queue |
| Map | Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table |
| List | Dynamic Array, Linked List |

# Computational Complexity Analysis

## Big-O Notation
Big-O Noation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, healping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitararily large. 

> Big-O only cares about the worst case.

### n - The size of the input complexities ordered in from smallest to largest:

|  X  |  Y  |
| --- | --- |
| Constant Time: | **O(1)** |
| Logarithmic Time: | **O(log(n))** |
| Linear Time: | **O(n)** |
| Linearithmic Time: | **O(nlog(n))** |
| Quadric Time: | **O(n<sup>2</sup>)** |
| Cubic Time: | **O(n<sup>3</sup>)** |
| Exponential Time: | **O(b<sup>n</sup>)** |
| Factorial Time: | **O(n!)** |
