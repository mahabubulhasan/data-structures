# Stack

A stack is a one-ended linear data structure which models a real world stack by having two primary operations, namely push and pop.

### When and where is a Stack used?
- Used by undo mechanisms in text editors
- Used in compiler syntax checkning for maching brackets
- Can be used to model a pile of books or plates
- Used behind the scens to support recursion by keeping track of previous functions calls
- Can be used to do Depth First Search on a graph

### Complexity

| Searching | O(n) |
| Size | O(1) |
